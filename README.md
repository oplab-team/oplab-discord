# oplab-discord

oplab-discord is a Discord bot for the [Oplab option simulation platform](https://oplab.com.br).

## Installation
In order for the bot to work on your Discord server, first you need to follow this [guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).
Then, create in your main folder, a `.env` file containing the environment variables necessary for this project to work:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN='YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN'
OPLAB_TOKEN='YOU_OPLAB_TOKEN'
COMMAND_PREFIX='+'
```


Install the dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install 
```

And then, start it.

```bash
npm start
```

## Contributing
You can send your contributions!

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

If you don' know where to start, I suggest you take a look at [Oplab's not-so-public API](https://docs.oplab.com.br).

You will also need an Oplab account in order for it to work. I suggest you pay the full price, since it's a great platform!
